This is my very first experiment making 2D games so I decided to build it using [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org) engine which is surprisingly fast, lightweight and Open Source so you don't need to pay anyone for using it, but a little help to the community is appreciated.

The Game
--------

My idea is to create a basic drag and drop game varying the challenge and increasing the difficulty by level. At the begin should be simple so any toddler can play it.

The project
-----------
This example just have a few scenes and a little code to show what can be accomplished in Godot with *GDScript* (whish is very similar to Python). The next step is to add difficulty, more items, levels and any other cool stuff.

You can learn more about Godot with the videos from [Gamefromscratch.com in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWB-HVFxEpU&index=1&list=PLS9MbmO_ssyAXRl-_ktrebQBFxjSQt7UX).
